   - *Threat Example*: Unauthorized access leading to code tampering or leakage.
   - *Remediation*: Implement role-based access controls and use multi-factor authentication. Regularly review access permissions.
   - *Mitigation*: Audit trails and alerts for unauthorized access attempts.

2. **What measures are in place to ensure the integrity of the code in repositories?**
   - *Context*: Code integrity checks prevent tampering and ensure that only valid code is moved along the pipeline.
   - *Threat Example*: Injection of malicious code into the repository.
   - *Remediation*: Use cryptographic signing of commits and automated integrity checks before merges.
   - *Mitigation*: Continuous monitoring and immediate rollback capabilities for detected unauthorized changes.

#### Build Server Security
1. **How is the security of the build server maintained?**
   - *Context*: Build servers are critical points in the CI/CD pipeline where code is compiled, making them prime targets for attacks.
   - *Threat Example*: Compromise of the build server leading to the distribution of malicious binaries.
   - *Remediation*: Keep the build server patched and secured. Use dedicated servers for building applications.
   - *Mitigation*: Real-time threat detection systems and automated security scanning of the build environment.

2. **Are build processes isolated and auditable?**
   - *Context*: Isolating build processes helps in minimizing risk exposure and ensuring reproducibility.
   - *Threat Example*: Cross-contamination between build processes leading to unintended code or dependency inclusion.
   - *Remediation*: Use containerized environments for each build to ensure process isolation. Implement logging for all build processes.
   - *Mitigation*: Regular audit of build logs and process checks.

#### Automated Testing and Security Scanning
1. **What automated security testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline?**
   - *Context*: Automated security testing ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed early in the development lifecycle.
   - *Threat Example*: Introduction of vulnerabilities in code, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - *Remediation*: Integrate tools like static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the pipeline.
   - *Mitigation*: Frequent updates to testing tools to recognize new vulnerabilities and coding guideline enforcement.

2. **How are dependencies managed and secured?**
   - *Context*: Dependencies should be kept up-to-date and sourced from trusted repositories to prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities.
   - *Threat Example*: Use of outdated or compromised libraries leading to vulnerable applications.
   - *Remediation*: Use automated tools to track and update dependencies. Implement strict policies for the use of third-party libraries.
   - *Mitigation*: Regular security audits of third-party dependencies and use of software composition analysis (SCA) tools.

#### Deployment Automation
1. **How is the deployment process secured against unauthorized changes?**
   - *Context*: Deployment automation can be a vector for attacks if not properly secured, leading to unauthorized changes in the production environment.
   - *Threat Example*: Unauthorized deployment that introduces backdoors or other malicious functions.
   - *Remediation*: Use automated gates and approval processes for deployments. Enforce manual review for critical deployments.
   - *Mitigation*: Deployment verification tests and rollback capabilities for detected issues.

2. **What mechanisms are in place to ensure the integrity and security of artifacts before deployment?**
   - *Context*: Ensuring the integrity of artifacts before deployment prevents the execution of tampered or unauthorized code.
   - *Threat Example*: Manipulation of artifacts before they are deployed to production.
   - *Remediation*: Cryptographically sign artifacts and verify signatures before deployment.
   - *Mitigation*: Use an artifact repository with integrity checking and version control capabilities.
